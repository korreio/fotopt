### Added

- Started creating a section on GREAT PHOTOGRAPHERS. For now, this section is included in the TECHNIQUES. Please also contribute with original texts about other photographers.

## [18.04.2000]

### Added

- Created a new topic in the galleries titled "Historical Moments" where you can upload photos that document significant historical events.
- Due to various reasons, we've decided to limit the number of photos per member. For now, the photo limit (200 per author) is more than sufficient to accommodate any of the existing galleries. When you upload photos, the system will tell you how many more you can upload.

## [27.04.2000]

### Added

- Created a field in the photo data where it is now possible to specify the date the photos were taken. To add this information to your previously uploaded photos, just open them and select the option "CHANGE DATA OR DELETE".

## [01.05.2000]

### Updated

- Made some minor but significant changes to the site's terms of service, which all members are asked to read. If you've read the document before, you only need to read the yellow-highlighted CONDUCT RULES section. The new rules are there to prevent the possible posting of very low-quality images due to the rapid evolution of the site - we hope no one is alarmed!

## [02.05.2000]

## [03.05.2000]

## [04.05.2000]

### Updated

- The highlight section for this month is finally complete with the selection of the winning photos from the theme of April (Animals).

## [05.05.2000]

### Updated

- As you may have noticed, the HISTORICAL MOMENTS gallery has been highlighted due to the unique images it contains, representing events that have become part of our history. Please be selective with the images you post in this gallery. We are also considering adding a chronicle section where members who have lived these events can describe their stories and memories. Any suggestion or criticism is welcome.
- In the event of a tie in the monthly photo contest, the winning photographs will be displayed alternately on the homepage.

## [08.05.2000]

### Announced

## [11.05.2000]

### Updated

- Reorganized the HISTORY section.
- The EVENTS section has been reorganized.

## [12.05.2000]

### Added

- Added some items to the GALLERIES section.

## [15.05.2000]

### Updated

- Authors who have been or will be highlighted now have a small reward - they can now insert 400 photos in their gallery - instead of the usual 200.

## [16.05.2000]

### Updated

- To improve the international aspect of the site, it is now possible to have the name and description of the author gallery sub-themes in English. To change your sub-themes, go to "EDIT THEMES" when you are in your gallery (after logging in).

## [17.05.2000]

### Updated

- It's now possible to insert the title of photos simultaneously in Portuguese and English - so that the international version of the site is more coherent for foreigners. If you want, you can add the title in English to your photos by opening them and pressing "CHANGE DATA OR DELETE" (after logging in). If you don't write a title in English, the Portuguese title will appear on the international version of the site.

## [20.05.2000]

### Security Update

- For security reasons, it is now impossible to use HTML "tags" in any comment posted on the site. You can insert them, but they won't be processed when shown.

## [22.05.2000]

### Added

- Posted a new text in the TECHNIQUES section, titled "PAPER DRYING".
- At the request of several members, a CHRONICLES section is now available where you can write stories, memories, or experiences related to your photos. To do this, simply select your photo on which you want to insert the text and press the "CHRONICLES" option - obviously only available after logging in. Photos with associated chronicles will have the "CHRONICLES" link and are also available in the galleries section under "PHOTOS WITH CHRONICLES" (at the bottom of the page).

## [23.05.2000]

### Updated

- Member lists (in the member and gallery sections) now appear sorted vertically instead of horizontally.

## [25.05.2000]

### Updated

- Changes to the PHOTOS WITH CHRONICLES page - accessible through the HISTORIC MOMENTS section or in GALLERIES.

## [26.05.2000]

### Updated

- The entire site code and server configuration have been reviewed over the past 3 days to try and speed up access. (for this reason, the server was down occasionally during these days). I believe the speed has improved significantly, but it is possible that something may have been overlooked - if you find any "bugs", please let me know. Thank you.

## [30.05.2000]

### Updated

- Minor modification to the links available on each page. Thus, there is now an "AUTHOR CARD" link in the author's gallery. "COMMENTS TO AUTHOR" are now only available on the author's card. "INSERT PHOTO" and "EDIT THEMES" are now only available in the galleries.
- There is now a direct link to your member card in the MEMBERS section, provided you are logged in.
- Created a gallery for each member titled "FAVORITE PHOTOS GALLERY" where each member can put their favorite photos from the site. To view an author's favorite photo gallery, choose the FAVORITES option on the respective member's card. To insert a photo in this gallery, simply choose the FAVORITES option on any photo (after logging in). To remove, choose the same option when you are viewing a photo from your favorites gallery. This gallery is especially for highlighting those photos that we always want to have "at hand" - whether for our enjoyment whenever we want, or to show to friends. It's as easy as saying - "See my favorite gallery". I think it will also be interesting to see each of our preferences. My idea is to one day also allow creating themes (folders) within our favorite gallery to help divide them, but for now it is not possible.

## [31.05.2000]

### Added

- Now in the MEMBERS section, it's possible to see a list of members who have a favorite photos gallery.
- Now when you press E-MAIL (in the left menu) you are taken to a list of frequently asked questions (with their respective answers). I strongly advise less experienced members (and even experienced ones) to check if they know everything that is there. :-)

## [01.06.2000]

### Updated

- Now along with the photo data, there is also information about how many members have it as a favorite (and a link to the list of these members). In addition, it's possible to see if the photo won the theme of the month, photo of the month, or if it was chosen by the jury for the highlight gallery of some month.

## [02.06.2000]

### Reminder

- Just reminding everyone that you only have a week left to sign up for FOTO@PT's anniversary. Read the details on the link on the homepage. Participate! :-)
- Request to all members who have items in the used section (for search or sale) to verify if the ads that are still there are valid - if not, please remove them.

## [05.06.2000]

### Update

- Regarding "pass the camera" - you can continue to use the forum to organize, but if you can wait a few more days, I'll create a section on the site dedicated solely to the event where you can sign up more efficiently.

## [06.06.2000]

### Update

- The "identification of site members" vote has been slightly altered, now only the two options that I think are viable to implement are available. I took advantage of the previous votes that fit into these two possibilities.

## [07.06.2000]

### New Features

- You can now sign up for "Pass the Camera" through this site - go to the HIGHLIGHTS section - it's right at the top.
- I am delighted to finally announce a surprise that I've been holding onto for over a month... Starting today, SUPER PHOTO PRACTICE magazine has a page solely dedicated to photos from foto@pt!! If all goes well, every month 6 photos chosen from the winners of the theme of the month, photo of the month, and highlight gallery will be featured in this section of the magazine. (with the due authorizations of their authors, obviously). This is a great incentive for all of us to take better and better photos and put them on the site. You can see the first gallery of SUPER PHOTO PRACTICE in the "HIGHLIGHTS" section.
- Changed the site's home page, now at the top position the winners of the previous month's photo and those who are winning this month alternate. Below, the winners of the theme of the month, the photos of the highlighted author, and the photos of the highlighted gallery will alternate.

## [08.06.2000]

### Coming Soon

- Next month, the "Chronicle of the Month" contest will begin. A jury will choose the best chronicle (or the best ones) among all those inserted in the previous month, these chronicles will be highlighted during the following month. So pick up your pen (or keyboard in this case) and tell us about your adventures, techniques, experiences, and memories related to your photos.

## [09.06.2000]

### Added & Updated

- Created a page where I will try to keep the history of the camera that will "Walk from Hand to Hand" - meanwhile, the event changed its name to "Camera from Hand to Hand". This page also includes the list of the first 24 participants - you can get there by pressing the link at the top of the "HIGHLIGHTS".
- Division of the ARCHITECTURE AND SCULPTURE gallery into two different galleries.

## [10.06.2000]

### New Contest

- Created the contest "In search of a new logo for foto@pt". You can see details by clicking on the link that is on the home page or at the top of the highlights.

## [11.06.00]

### Update

- Authors who want to remain anonymous can now hide their real name from other members. However, they will always be required to provide their real name upon registration. To understand why this decision was made, read my "Identification of members" message in the "SITE" section of the FORUM.

## [12.06.2000]

### Update

- There are already 4 proposals for the site's logo, you can see them on the contest page. But I'm still waiting for as many proposals as possible. Participate! :-)

## [14.06.2000]

### Change in Communication

- Recently, the number of forum messages discussing site-related improvements has been high. These messages, although important, distract members who are not interested in the topic from what the site is really dedicated to - photography. Therefore, the forum section dedicated to the site has been removed, leaving the forum exclusively dedicated to photography-related topics. All debates related to site improvements and evolution will be continued (and only accepted) on the associated mailing list. This way only those who are really interested will have to read the many messages that have been sent. This decision also prevents the need to discuss the same thing twice...

## [17.06.2000]

### New Feature

- There is now a way to log out (only for members who log in, obviously :-)). When you no longer need to access member-exclusive options, you can log out by going back to the MEMBERS section. This way no one will be able to use your member account improperly if you leave the computer. If you don't, the system does it automatically after 20 minutes of inactivity or when you close your browser (or computer).

## [21.06.2000]

### Update

- The minimum time unit for news (for members who log in) has become the second (it was the day).
- IMPORTANT!! The restaurant for the foto@pt anniversary is already booked. Those who signed up can see where it is, and other details, on the page dedicated to the Anniversary, in the HIGHLIGHTS section. Please pay special attention to the MENU part.

## [23.06.2000]

### Anniversary

- foto@pt turns one year old today!! :-) To celebrate the first anniversary, you can see in the "ONE YEAR AGO..." section, daily, what was new on the site exactly one year ago. I think it's especially a good way to remember photos that many have forgotten. You can access this section from the NEWS or the main page. I suggest you use the GUESTBOOK section if you want to congratulate the site, say what you think of its evolution, criticize, praise (never too much ;-)), etc... (note: the logo page has left the site cover, but is still available in the highlights)

## [24.06.2000]

### Updates

- The photo of the month section has been altered. Now you can only see the list of results for a month at the end of the corresponding vote. Otherwise, the voting method remains unchanged.
- You can now choose how you want the news to be shown when you log in, the options are: per second (default for everyone, as it is now); per minute; per hour; and per day (as it was until a few days ago). To change, just go to your member form and press change data. The option is at the bottom, in ADVANCED OPTIONS.

## [27.06.2000]

### New Section

- A page dedicated to the anniversary photos of foto@pt is now available. It currently has some photos, but I will add more soon. The page is accessible through the HIGHLIGHTS section (right at the top).

## [28.06.2000]

### Update

- Just added some more images to the page dedicated to the site's anniversary lunch (in the HIGHLIGHTS section) - there are now 30 photos there.

## [02.07.2000]

### Update

- With the disclosure of the gallery chosen by the jury, this month's highlights page is now finished. The Super Foto Prática gallery will be exhibited when the magazine comes out.
- Started a new section within TECHNIQUES, titled "BASIC PHOTOGRAPHY EXAMPLE BY EXAMPLE" which aims to be a small course especially dedicated to amateurs. Over the next few weeks, I will add new topics that are already in development (related to lenses, flash, filters, etc...). As I do not consider myself a pro in these things, please carefully check if I made mistakes and let me know by email (as well as your opinion about the course).

## [03.07.2000]

### Update

- Added more 7 pages to the section "BASIC PHOTOGRAPHY EXAMPLE BY EXAMPLE", available from the TECHNIQUES section. This time the topics are - negative contrast, emulsions (films), lenses, and polarizing filter.

## [04.07.2000]

### Update

- Added another topic to the BASIC PHOTOGRAPHY by examples course. This time it is about colored filters.

## [07.07.2000]

### Updates

- For when it's necessary to clarify doubts, the entire COPYRIGHT LAW present in Portuguese legislation is now available. You can access it by going to MEMBERS->SERVICE TERMS->COPYRIGHT LAW.
- Members who log in can now choose how many photos are displayed on each page of the galleries (6, 8, 10, 12, 15 or 20). I think it will be very practical for those who use high resolutions.
- From now on, the gallery of photos published this month in the Super Foto Prática magazine is available. Check out the HIGHLIGHTS section.

## [10.07.2000]

### Update

- With the recent accelerated growth of foto@pt, I was forced to reduce the limit of photos that each member can have in their gallery to a more "acceptable" value.

## [12.07.2000]

### Update

- At the request of some members who have not known the site since its early days, I have made available a version that is more than 9 months old just for reminiscing. You can see it and play with it as much as you want, as it is fully functional (you just can't upload photos). Many photos from that time have been deleted by their authors, so they do not appear. Note - changes made to the old site do not propagate to the current version.

## [15.07.2000]

### Update

- The first image of the history of the "Hand-to-Hand Camera" event is now available. You can see it in HIGHLIGHTS->HAND TO HAND CAMERA->MACHINES.

## [16.07.2000]

### Update

- The time limit for new members to confirm their registrations has been reduced from 1 month to 2 weeks.

## [18.07.2000]

### Updates

- To help calibrate the monitors to view the site photos well, Ricardo Abranches sent me the text that I posted in GALLERIES->CALIBRATE MONITOR and in the techniques section.
- Created the PHOTO CRITIQUE gallery - aimed at those photos where the authors would like to have more complete comments than usual because we have doubts about their quality. More experienced members are thus especially encouraged to constructively criticize these photos in terms of technique and propose possible improvements. You can insert photos in this gallery and access it by going to GALLERIES->PHOTO CRITIQUE.

## [24.07.2000]

### Update

- It is now also possible to place on your personal pages a direct link to the foto@pt member card, but in the English version of the site. See more details by going to your member card and pressing the LINK option.

## [27.07.2000]

### Announcement

- As the end of the month approaches, I just want to ask those who have not yet voted in the photo of the month to do so in the next 5 days - help the new voting method to be a success! Thank you.

## [03.08.2000]

### Update

- Some photos from the 2nd foto@pt members' lunch are now available. You can see them through the HIGHLIGHTS section. The pages that cease to be current (such as the one referring to the 1st anniversary lunch) remain available by pressing ARCHIVE both in the highlights section and in the history.

## [08.08.2000]

### Update

- The gallery of photographs that came out this month in Super Foto Prática is now available in the HIGHLIGHT section.

## [14.08.2000]

### Update

- More photos from the 2nd foto@pt members' lunch are now available in the Highlights section.

## [14.08.2000]

### Update

- The magazine RAIO X has this month dedicated a section only to foto@pt, so it also has, from now on, a place in Highlights.

## [23.08.2000]

### Announcement

- Just a reminder that we are one week away from the end of the month and I'm asking those who have not yet voted in the photo of the month and want to contribute to do so in the next few days. Thank you.

## [29.08.2000]

### Announcement

- I apologize to all members for the downtime the site experienced (almost 3 days). I had no opportunity to restore it in the last few days - and as the site is developed and managed only by me, there was nobody to replace me... I hope this doesn't happen again.

## [07.09.2000]

### Update

- Just announced the set of photographs that the magazine Super Foto Prática published this month. You can see the gallery in the Highlight section.

## [09.09.2000]

### Announcement

- A small reminder: The "Historical Moments" gallery is only for images that directly document a significant moment that has become a part of all our history. I get the impression that many people confuse "Moments" with "Monuments" as many photos of castles, statues, etc. are posted there... Logically these photos are moved to another gallery as they do not fit in this one.

## [19.09.2000]

### Announcement

- Just want to highlight the 3rd FOTO@PT MEMBERS LUNCH. Let's see if we can attract a good number of people for it to be a success.

## [22.09.2000]

### Update

- As you can see on the Jury page, foto@pt has gained 3 new members to the jury team. This group of people (Alcino Viana, JMF Coutinho and JR Garcia) will choose the Chronicle of the Month which, in principle, starts already for the coming month.

## [26.09.2000]

### Update

- From now on, each member can only insert one image per day that has passed since their last insertion, up to a maximum of 4 photos on the same day.

## [30.09.2000]

### Update

- The first chronicles for the new highlight section - the Chronicles of the Month have been chosen. 3 jury members choose the best chronicle of the previous month every month (in this case, from August). But as the selection started 4 months after the feature of inserting chronicles was created, this month also a winner from May (the 1st month in which there were chronicles) was chosen. It will be like this until the backlog months are exhausted. The winning chronicles will be available as soon as the month changes.

## [01.10.2000]

### Update

- I've just made available all the highlights for this month that were still pending. Congratulations to those highlighted.

## [02.10.2000]

### Update

- I've just announced the photographs that were published this month in Super Foto Prática. You can see them in the highlights.

## [17.10.2000]

### Update

- Minor modifications in the news section. The list of comments doesn't immediately appear as it was huge. Now there is a separate page just for new comments.

## [30.10.2000]

### Update

- I've just installed a new component on the site to generate the thumbnails (reduced images) of the photos. In principle, this is much faster and will cause the server to "crash" less than usual. But it's possible it may have a bug or two, if you have any issues, please notify me by email.

## [01.11.2000]

### Update

- There was a small lapse in the availability of this month's highlights, but everything is now in order. The only thing missing is the final gallery of the choices for the theme of the month, which should be available later today.

## [01.11.2000]

### Update

- Available now, in the Highlights section, is the jury's choice of last month's Theme - "The Body".

## [03.11.2000]

### Update

- The gallery of photos published this month in Super Foto Prática is now available. Unfortunately, one of the published ones was removed from the site, so it's not available.

## [11.11.2000]

### Update

- Foto@pt just gained two more members to the jury. I invited Berenice Kauffmann Abud and Teresa Monteiro, who accepted to come help us choose the Author of the Month and a new highlight category that will be launched very soon.

## [17.11.2000]

### Announcement

- Voting for the photo of the month has been very dead in recent months. Let's try to liven it up - contribute by voting!

## [17.11.2000]

### Update

- "From now on, the foto@pt jury will choose authors to receive the HONORABLE MENTION. This highlight is given to authors whose gallery the jury considers to be above average in terms of quality. There is no limit to the number of authors who can receive this mention monthly, and it can be awarded at any time. These authors receive a bonus of +20 photos on the limit of their gallery and have a separate list in the GALLERIES section (as is the case for the authors of the month). These authors are still eligible, like all others, to later receive the AUTHOR OF THE MONTH highlight. If this happens, they no longer have the HONORABLE MENTION, and simply become AUTHORS OF THE MONTH, so the bonus is only +100 photos. For the debut of this new highlight, we already have 5 authors, as you can see in the news. Congratulations to those highlighted!"

## [18.11.2000]

### Update

- Better late than never! Finally, some photos from the 3rd lunch of foto@pt members, which took place in Coimbra, are available. You can see them by going to the HIGHLIGHTS section.

## [23.11.2000]

### Update

- There is now a list available with all the members who are on the site at any given moment. You can see it by going to the statistics page (which is available by clicking the access number, on the site cover, below). Then you just have to click MEMBERS PRESENT, at the top of the page. It's mainly for me to see how much the server is "suffering", but you might find it interesting too.

## [25.11.2000]

### Update

- Several members have complained that some items listed in the used section were no longer for sale, however the ad was still there. To prevent this situation, from now on all items listed in the USED section will automatically be removed after one month. The same goes for job opportunities and job applicants listed in the JOB section, but here the period is 2 months. Logically, if it's still valid, the item can be relisted.

## [05.12.2000]

### Update

- With the selection of the winning photos of the Theme of the Month, the Highlights section for December is now complete. As soon as the SFP magazine is out, I will also put the published photos there.

## [06.12.2000]

### Update

- I have just announced, in the HIGHLIGHT section, which photos were published this month in the Super Foto Prática magazine.

## [06.12.2000]

### Update

- I've created a new type of article in the OPINION section for Slide Projectors.

## [09.12.2000]

### Update

- Better late than never... Finally, I finished the page dedicated to the 3rd lunch of the site. You can see all the photographs, taken by the various participants, in the highlight section.

## [11.12.2000]

### Update

- Please start using the EVENTS theme in the forum to discuss matters related to meetings, lunches, exhibitions, etc... All messages of this type that were in OTHERS have been transferred there.

## [11.12.2000]

### Update

- I just placed the last photos dedicated to the 3rd lunch of the site (in the highlights section) on the dedicated page. Also, I corrected some captions that were swapped...

## [14.12.2000]

### Request

- I would like to get as many members' opinions as possible about the functionality and design of this new version of the site: Foto@pt, version 2.0. Please note - this is just an experimental version. Only the menu links work, some lead to repeated places, there's no cover yet, and almost all options for each section are missing (the only one that has some options is the used market). The realization of this new version became essential because in the current one it was no longer possible to add more options to the left menu (in 800x600 resolutions). Besides, I think that after some habit, the new interface becomes much more intuitive than the current one, especially for new members. Please send your opinion directly to me by email or to the "fotoempt" mailing list. Thank you.

## [20.12.2000]

### Message

- This message is just to wish a Merry Christmas and a prosperous year 2001 to all users of foto@pt.

## [30.12.2000]

### Update

- I just announced the Themes of the Month for the year 2001. I tried to base it as much as possible on the themes you proposed in the poll I created a few months ago. You can see them in the section dedicated to them.

## [03.01.2001]

### Update

- With the announcement of the photos published this month in Super Foto Prática, the highlight section for January is now complete.

## [05.01.2001]

### Note

- I just want to draw your attention to the section that is in the spotlight this month - OPINION. Give your contribution to this section by saying what you think of the photographic material you've tried. Many members send me emails asking if they should buy this or that camera, flash, film, etc... If each site member posted at least one opinion, we would already have over two thousand, which would be a great help for those deciding what to buy.

## [21.01.2001]

### Apology

- I sincerely apologize to all members of foto@pt for the numerous interruptions there have been lately. These outages are due to an unexpected increase in access to the site, which causes the machine where it is to "crash" because of the overload (it's an old machine). I hope to give some "vitamins" (more RAM) to this machine from the beginning of next week so that it holds on until the already promised server that will replace it arrives - which should happen by the beginning of next month. The slowness that is noticeable at certain times will, probably, also be remedied with this new server. Thank you very much for your patience.

## [01.02.2001]

### Update

- I just released the photo gallery of the Theme of the Month chosen by the jury.

## [02.02.2001]

### Request

- Vote for foto@pt for the 2001 JETNET trophies. Read details by clicking on: JETNET. All votes are precious!!

## [09.02.2001]

### Update

- Minor modifications to the operation of the forum. Now the various debates are divided into pages to speed up navigation.

## [10.02.2001]

### Notice

- I advise all members who are aware of the latest controversies of the site to read my message in the "OTHERS" forum with the title of LETTER TO MEMBERS.

## [24.02.2001]

### Update

- Debates created in the "others" forum and all votes are from today moderated. That is, only after being read and approved by the webmaster will they be made available to other members.

## [28.02.2001]

### Notice

- As you may notice, the addresses "fotografia.em.pt" and "www.fotografia.em.pt" are again functional! Therefore, I have a request - please, stop using gasa.dcea.fct.unl.pt/foto, and start using the above ones - although they go to the same place, the server configuration is different and you're "helping" it by using the first ones. One more note for those who have links on personal pages to foto@pt: due to this configuration change, I appreciate if you change them to those indicated on the instructions page about links - you can get there by going to your member profile and choosing the LINK option. Thank you.

## [28.02.2001]

### Reminder

- I just want to remind you that today is the last day you can vote for the February photo of the month - participate! Thank you.

## [28.02.2001]

### Request

- A week before the end of the vote in JetNet 2001, I make a final appeal to your votes in foto@pt. You can read details at this link. Thank you all.

## [02.03.2001]

### Update

- With the announcement of the winning photos of the theme of the month, the highlight section of March is complete.

## [03.03.2001]

### Notice

- Due to the confusions and abuses that the "Historic Moments" gallery has caused, it is from now on impossible to insert more photos in this gallery. I hope to soon find a different method to classify which photos should end up there and which ones should leave.

## [07.03.2001]

### Thank You Note

- I could not fail to thank all those who contributed with their votes to JetNet 2001. Those who did not vote yet still have until the end of today (March 7) to do so. Thank you very much.

## [07.03.2001]

### Update

- Two things have been changed in the members' data. First, the "age" data no longer exists and has been replaced by "date of birth" - this way, the age is calculated automatically without the need for updating. Ages were removed, so those who want to have it available will need to update their data. The other modification is that the space available for the "presentation" has quadrupled, so you can better introduce yourselves to other members. If you want to change these data, just go to your member profile and press CHANGE DATA.

## [15.03.2001]

### Notice

- The much-awaited new machine to replace the old foto@pt server arrived yesterday. Unfortunately, it came with some broken components... :-( So, I temporarily had to host the site on an intermediate machine (not as good as the new one, not as bad as the old one). This was the reason the site was down almost all of today. In principle, this machine should hold up much better than the old one and browsing the site at peak times should be much faster. If you find any navigation problems, please let me know by email.

## [15.03.2001]

### Update

- As many of you may already know, another novelty is that foto@pt is one of the 3 nominees for JetNet 2001, in the Culture section. I couldn't help but thank all those who contributed with their votes to make this a reality!! Thank you very much!! You can see more details at jetnet.telepac.pt.

## [22.03.2001]

### Notice

- For those interested - I have placed new photos on the page dedicated to the JetNet gala. If anyone else has something related to it that they want to put there, please send it to me by email. Thank you.

## [28.03.2001]

### Announcement

- Foto@pt now has a presentation brochure, which will be used in all events related to the site or simply for its promotion. See details in the highlights section or in -> brochure.

## [30.03.2001]

### Notice

- Foto@pt will stop shortly for maintenance (machine change). It will be back in a few hours (around 2 or 3 in the morning). I ask for everyone's understanding.

## [01.04.2001]

### Request

- Please read the 3 messages I posted in the "others" forum.

## [01.04.2001]

### Update

- Foto@pt is now on a brand new machine, so it was stopped for a few hours on Friday. A machine with 2 processors at 866Mhz, half a GB of RAM, and a SCSI 3 disk. I think the change significantly sped things up now that the site is increasingly visited and the number of crashes since then was 0! :-)

## [02.04.2001]

### Update

- The "flash" data, associated with photography, has been renamed to "lighting", thus becoming more comprehensive.

## [02.04.2001]

### Update

- Similar to what was already happening with the "others" forum, all themes are now moderated. Only new debates will be available to the "public" after being approved by the webmaster.

## [26.04.2001]

### Reminder

- I just want to once again incite the vote in the photo of the month - it's not hard - spend 5 minutes giving your opinion. The participation has been so low... Thank you.

## [01.05.2001]

### Update

- With the announcement of the winners of the Theme of the Month and the Chronicle of the Month, the May highlight section is concluded.

## [16.05.2001]

### Notice

- With the growth of the number of site members, the amount of photos inserted daily was becoming unbearable - both on the part of the server, and for the members who like to appreciate almost all of them. Therefore, the daily photo limit is now ONE - unconditionally (there will be no accumulation for days in which no photo was inserted). This measure takes effect today, so some members will have managed to insert more than one.

## [17.05.2001]

### Update

- I have again created the SITE theme in the DEBATES section - dedicated to discussing matters related to the site. The only problem is that these debates tend to be more animated than those about photography itself. Therefore, to not overload people who are not interested in this topic, the new SITE theme messages will not appear in the NEWS section.

## [18.05.2001]

### Update

- The themes of the galleries are now sorted in alphabetical order.

## [01.06.2001]

### Update

- To "spread" the insertion of photographs in a more uniform way throughout the day, the image limit per member is now one every 24 hours. That is, what counts is the time you inserted the last image, not the end of the day itself.

## [01.06.2001]

### Announcement

- I have already announced the winning photos of the theme of the month and the chronicle of the month. You can see them in the HIGHLIGHT section.

## [05.06.2001]

### Announcement

- I just announced the images published this month in Super Photo Practice. You can see them in the HIGHLIGHT section.

## [06.06.2001]

### Announcement

- As you surely noticed, I just replaced foto@pt with the version I have been working on for a few months. I hope you like it. I know many people will find the navigation method strange, but after a period of adaptation, I think this interface is even better. I hope you like it!

## [08.06.2001]

### Update

- The GALLERIES section now includes a part entitled PREFERRED, where you can see the gallery of favorite photos of each member and the TOP PREFERRED.

## [12.06.2001]

### Update

- There is now the functionality to choose PREFERRED AUTHORS. So each member can create a list with their preferred authors. Open the member's card of the author you prefer and press INSERT IN MY PREFERENCES. You can view a member's list of preferred authors through their member card or through the MEMBERS-> PREFERRED AUTHORS section.

## [17.06.2001]

### Update

- Slight aesthetic adjustment of the menus to include new features, namely:
  - PRINT MODE - requested by several members to facilitate the printing of comments, techniques, etc... In this mode the menus disappear.
  - HELP - is now below.
  - FOTO@PT CLOCK - the server time is also always available now.
  - I also took the opportunity to make a "weight loss cure" to the menu code, making it 30% smaller and therefore much faster.

## [05.07.2001]

### Announcement

- The first Exhibition of Photographs by foto@pt authors is inaugurated. All members and visitors are invited to appear on this day, or any other day, until August 4. More information is available on the EXHIBITION PAGE.

## [02.07.2001]

### Announcement

- The jury's choices for this month have been announced and can be viewed in HIGHLIGHTS-> THIS MONTH.

## [18.06.2001]

### Changed

- The space dedicated to "author's comments" is now double the size (20 lines, 1200 characters).

## [21.08.2001]

### Added

- A new option is now available in the photos - "COMPLETE PHOTO FILE". By clicking here, you will access a page that, in addition to the photo and its data, also displays the chronicle, the comments, and the people who preferred that photo.
- If you prefer to always see photos with the "COMPLETE FILE", you can now select this option in the special options (go to the member file, click on the CHANGE DATA option, and at the bottom you have the special options).
- Photos with winning chronicles of the "CHRONICLE OF THE MONTH" will also be worth a bonus of 1 photo in the author's gallery.

## [22.08.2001]

### Added

- A new section named "FOTO@PT EVENTS" is now available in the HIGHLIGHTS. This 100% automatic section is intended to include photographs taken by members during various events related to foto@pt.

## [24.08.2001]

### Changed

- In an author's contribution, comments are now on a separate page, similar to the news, to reduce the weight of the page.

## [03.09.2001]

### Update

- Finished the highlight section of this month, with the announcement of the winning photos of the month's theme, the chronicle of the month and the photos published in Super Photo Practice.

## [14.09.2001]

### Added

- There is now the possibility for new photos to remain anonymous for a week (however appearing in our galleries).
- The rotation of the 2 photos on the website's homepage has changed. From now on, in the upper position, photos of the highlighted author and the top 5 positions of the photo of the month alternate. Below, highlighted photos and the theme of the month's photos alternate.

## [27.09.2001]

### Update

- The number of times a photo is visited is now counted, but this information is only available to the author of each photo.

## [02.10.2001]

### Update

- In the forum, there are now two options to go to the next or previous message in a given debate.

## [10.10.2001]

### Added

- The way of viewing the galleries has changed a bit to be able to support a new feature - the "AUTHOR'S FAVORITE PHOTOS" galleries - where each author can place up to 10 of their images that they like the most in their own gallery. To put photos in this gallery, you just need to open one of your photos and choose the "INSERT IN MY FAVORITES" option, just like you do for other authors' photos.

## [11.10.2001]

### Update

- There is now a new option when you are viewing your photo - CHANGE IMAGE - this option serves to replace the image with another similar one without losing any data associated with it. Please use this option when changing, for example, the contrast, or deciding to put margins, or you made a better scan, changed the size or resolution, etc. The image is not immediately changed, as the change will have to be previously confirmed by the webmaster (to prevent exchanges for different images), which may take a few days. Therefore, the old email exchange is no longer valid.

## [23.10.2001]

### Announcement

- I just want to encourage voting for the photo of the month, as participation has been very weak...

## [09.11.2001]

### Event

- Don't miss the OPENING OF THE 2nd FOTO@PT PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION this Saturday, the 10th, in Beja.

The gallery with the displayed photos will be available here from Sunday. It ends on November 24.

## [20.11.2001]

### Announcement

- The FOTO@PT BOOK is ready! Read all about this topic here.

## [29.11.2001]

### Announcement

- Once again, I'm here to encourage your massive vote in the photo of the month. The voting has been so weak (in the number of votes, not participants)... You have until tomorrow end of day to do it - it costs nothing... Thank you.

## [03.12.2001]

### Update

- The highlights section for this month is now complete.
- Click on the image to read all about the JetNet 2002 trophy. Don't forget to vote on foto@pt!

## [28.12.2001]

### Added

- There is now a new list of galleries in the GALLERIES->SPECIALS section, where all the photos that participated in the exhibitions and the site's book are displayed. These photos also count as a "bonus" for the respective authors' galleries. As I do not have a record of the photos that participated in the 1st exhibition, I ask, please, for the authors to tell me the IDs of these images.

## [02.01.2002]

### Update

- Like all of us, the site's jury also has the right to their annual rest. Therefore, during the month of January there will be no Theme of the Month, Highlighted Gallery and Chronicle of the Month, with only the categories of Author of the Month and Honorable Mentions being chosen. In February everything will return to normal, perhaps with some news.

## [18.01.2002]

### Added

- The forum now has a Netiquette page with basic good conduct rules that should be followed by all discussion group users.

## [31.01.2002]

### Announcement

- I just announced the first theme of the month of 2002 - "Nocturnal" - the most voted theme by the site members. In the next few days, I will announce the rest of the year.

## [14.02.2002]

### Announcement

- Read all about the CAIS - Foto@pt Contest, starting in March here on the site.

## [28.02.2002]

### Announcement

- During the month of March, the CAIS - Foto@pt contest will be running. Please read the introduction, regulations, and frequently asked questions pages carefully. If you win, you will have the opportunity to see your photos in CAIS magazine!

## [28.02.2002]

### Added

- I only remembered to create a gallery for the 1st collective photography foto@pt that took place in Brazil. It is now available in GALLERIES->SPECIALS. However, as I do not know the ID's of the photos that participated, I ask, please, for their authors to tell me, by email, the photos with which they participated.

## [05.03.2002]

### Update

- As promised, I have already started preparing the site for the future with new features. So, it is again possible to comment on photos, but all comments will have to be approved by the authors of the commented photos before they appear to other members. In addition, any author can at any time remove the comments they want from their photos.
  I hope with this measure to minimize offensive comments that appear on the site since the authors of the photos will have to approve them - besides taking this task off me.

## [05.03.2002]

### Update

-"Registration on the site is again possible, but now new members (and members with less than 5 photos in the gallery) will have their images moderated - until they are approved they are not shown to other members.
This is to try to prevent "quick incursions" by new members who only come here to destroy by inserting inappropriate photos.

## [05.03.2002]

### Announcement

- I would appreciate it if you let me know if you find any "bug" in the site's new features. Thank you.

## [05.03.2002]

### Added

- There is now the option to approve all comments of a photo at once, it's called APPROVE ALL COMMENTS - and you can see it in the left menu when you open the comments page of one of your photos.

## [06.03.2002]

### Update

- It is again possible to insert author comments, which, like photo comments, are now moderated by the commented authors - the operation is similar to photo comments.
  To make it easier, now whenever you have author or photo comments of yours to moderate, you will be notified when you log in and when you go to the detailed news.
  If you find problems with these new features, please let me know.

### Added

- The votes are also back, with minor changes, the main one being that the votes no longer have associated text. To vote now, you just have to open the voting and choose the "VOTE" option from the left menu.
- At the request of numerous members, I have now created an area for "unofficial" foto@pt events, available in the same place as the others: HIGHLIGHTS->FOTO@PT EVENTS. I immediately created an entry for the Guincho tour that happened a few days ago (organized on the "Written with Light" mailing list).
  The rules for creating other events are on that page, if you think you have photos of some, let me know.
  I had to impose a limit of photos per member for each event - so no member can put more than 15 photos per event.
  The photos inserted there by members with less than 5 photos in their main gallery are moderated to avoid abuses by "destructive" members.
  For now, the comments in this section are still inactive.

### Update

- I have updated the FAQ (frequently asked questions) to include the recent changes to the site, you can see it in USEFUL->FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. If you think there is any pertinent question missing, please let me know.

## [07.03.2002]

### Announcement

- The program for the 3rd Anniversary of Foto@pt is now available.

## [08.03.2002]

### Added

- Using the features provided by Google, it is now possible to perform text searches on the site, for this you just have to use the "search engine" available in the USEFUL->SEARCH section.

## [11.03.2002]

### Update

- Continuing the restructuring and "simplification" of the site, I have made some decisions aimed at ending features that, although useful to me, generate so much confusion that they can no longer exist:
  Contests and jury - all site contests are abolished, this includes the photo of the month and jury choices (leaving the latter non-existent). At the end of the month, they will go to the site archive. The only active contest is the CAIS one.
  Forum - when reactivated it will be 100% moderated and only photography will be discussed, any suggestion about the site should be sent by email to me.
  This is not related to controversies, but rather to the size of the site - all members who do not log in for more than 3 months will be removed, along with all their contribution.

## [09.04.2002]

### Removed

- The photo critique section ceased to exist today as it was rarely used for the purpose for which it was created.

### Update

- The categories formerly chosen by the jury and the photo of the month have today become a section of the site archive (HIGHLIGHTS-ARCHIVE) as they have been deactivated for a month.
- Since there are no longer any highlight categories, the photos that appear on the home page are now randomly chosen from the most visited by members during the entire existence of the site.
