# foto@pt - Fotografia em Português
Former site dedicated to publicising the work of Portuguese-speaking photographers, both amateur and professional.

First active in june 1999 and working until September 2002
Mostly ideated by Tiago Fonseca incorporating ideas from its users
Fully developed and administered by Tiago Fonseca

Had two URL in its life:

## Story and Context

1999, I was a computer science student and photography enthusiast. The web was something rather different from what
it is today. Facebook was 5 years away from being created, Instagram was not a word yet. Social Networking was not 
even part of the vocabulary.

My passion for photography led me to a mailing list called "Escrita com Luz" (litereally "Writing with Light". Some
100 people exchanged email messages on this list on topics of photography, sometime sharing their images for the other
hundred members to admired and comment.

Being only email based, it was not a very efficient way of communicating, there was no way to see the previous messages,
it was not public, there were no threads.

I was by then at the end of my computer science degree and working part time as a web developer for an investigation group
inside my univerive (NOVA School of Science and Technology, in Lisbon, Portugal) and somehow still had some free time on my 
hands. 

The idea came fast to my head: why don't I create a website with some of the same funcionality of the mailing list? 
Having posted the idea, it was welcomed by the other participants so I set to work. In a couple of weeks I had a 
first version up.

## Technology

I was then working with Active Server Pages (ASP), something that in the comming decades became completly obscolete,
it is now called "Legacy ASP". This was sometime before .Net. If I could see into the future I would have gone with PHP,
a language I used on most of my next projects.

The database was a simples Microsoft Access one, accessed through ODBC interface using SQL.

"Active" websites, as they were sometimes called back then where still relatively rare, most had pure static HTML 
content, and I was not expecting the projec to grow a lot (how I was mistaken), so I went quick and dirty - KISS
(Keep It Simples and Stupid).

It had mostly a Portuguese frontend, with some limited English functionality. The code was written in portuguese, I 
mean, names and comments, ASP is ASP.

## Popularity

In the next 3 years all hell broke loose. The website was indeed a huge success.

I think I can say it was one the first:
- websites open to anyone to showcase their photographs
- open for others to comment
- targeted at portuguese speaking photographers, both amator and professional
- social networks

First social network? Yep, it had a lot what most people take for granted in such platforms: a user page, user content
( not only photo posts but also text posts with "stories"), comments, voting for best pictures, foruns with very 
active discussions on all things photography.

Being the first of it's kind, it was soon being used by most people who had an interest in photography and sharing their
images. Remember this was a time when phones had no photo cameras and even digital cameras were in their infancy. So
reflex analogic cameras ruled. People digiticsed their photos before posting.

Having grabed the attention of the community the website had many professional photographers sharing their work.
Soon the website was published in every newspaper and magazine in Portugal (in paper, with URL written down, remmember
that?) and I was on TV some 3 or 4 times talking about it.

The server was a simple machine "hosted" in my university network. A Pentium machine that was actually under my desk.
Hosting it on professional datacenters was insanely expensive back then (clouds? in 1999? what's that?). Even hard 
drives with limited GB were quite expensive and data exchange also.

With some thousand people uploading pictures every day the server hard drive soon came to the limit, so I set about
to limit the number of pictures per user to 100 and picture upload to 1 picture per user per day.

This limitation was actually one of the reasons I think the website was so succcessful - people had to choose their
best works and as such the content became quite interesting and with lots of quality original content.

## Evolution

I kept the website my hobby and never tried to monitise it, being something that grew as community and with a lot
of help from others: I integrated the best ideas, made a logo contest and soon had a group of people acting as 
photo contest jury, for things like "Best picure of the month", "Topic of the month", "Author of the month".

The simples website soon had very active foruns, place to advertise photo related jobs openings, interactive boards
for post list of other photo websites (even Google and other search engines were at its infancym remember), photo 
books and I had a small section with my own content and images explaning photo techniques.

Flash websites were the rage by then, but I kept foto@pt simple: an efficent interface in pure HTML, with my own
design. Soon I had developed an administration section for my own working of the website. Unfortunatly from the 
start I made the mistake of thinking I would never need more than one system administrator and as such hardcoded
his (mine) autenthication, limiting the webmaster to only one (me).

By 2002 there where some 12.000 registred users, with at least 5.000 of them posting every day, adding up to more 
than 100.000 photos on the website. Comments on the photos grew to 1.5 milion. 

A basic monitoring system counted about 15.000 unique visitors per day, totaling up to more than 8 milion unique
visitiors in 2 years.

These numbers look ridiculous now, but remember this was 2 decades ago, for those too young to remember, people with 
Internet access at home were still few (at least in Portugal), and lots of websites actually had public "counters" 
proudly showing how many people accessed them - foto@pt also had it. :)

## Community

Such a big and active community interacted not only on the website but also a lot IRL. I had no time for so much
social activity, but its members joined to organize countless photo exibitions, workshops, photography encounters
and walks, lunches and dinners. All over Portugal (and even in Brazil) members shared their passion for photography.

## Book

In 2001 a rare oportunity was presented: one of the memebers of the website was part of Lisgráfica, a major
printing house in Portugal and offered to sponser the printing of a book dedicated to the website best works.

It was another huge project, but I am quite proud of the archivement. With the help of the website jury we
selected 200 of the best photos from 100 authors and did a run of 2000 books, with high quality paper and a 
very nice hardcover sponsered by the puslisher (Gótica). The graphic layout work was also ofered by a company 
from another of the photo users (eXistenz).

## Jetnet Awards

How small was the Internet in Portugal? Well, just imagine that you had a competition every year to come up with
the best website in several categories, like "Information", "Sports", "Culture".

JetNet awards was such an initiative, the biggest in Portugal. It was crearted, sponsered and managed by Telepac,
at the time Portugal's biggedt ISP. For 3 years (2000 to 2002) websites could apply to be part of a list of competitors
and everybody was invited to chose their favorite in each category.

foto@pt won the prize 2 years in a row in the "Cuture" category - 2001 and 2002. For such a small endeavour it was
a welcome recognition, given that the aversaries where mostly every culture website, public organization and major 
culture events in Portugal. Any that had a website, like makor museums and "culture cities" of the year.

## End of the dream

By 2003 I was working full time as developer and project manager for YDX Innovation and the website ketp on growing.
Administering such a social network alone occupied hours of my time dayly. Just checking if picture rules and copyright
complains were in check and moderating the photo comments and forum messages was a full time job.

The webserver was at it's limit of hard drive space and ASP pages processing. The Access database had grown to 200MB,
small by today's standard but way to much to be efficient on an Access database. The TODO of swapping Access for 
MS SQL or MySQL was pushed forever forward as was the code changes necessary for having multiple administrators.

And the university was starting to complain that such a simple server was using about 1/5 of it's total data
bandwidth. They never cut it, as it was a community projct with no commertial endeavour or money making scheme.

I still tried to find a partner to make it grow. The only possibility was moving to expensive servers and making
it a full time job, with some monetization, like adds. But even banners was something that took a lot of time to
setup and negotiate, one by one...

So in September 2002 I closed most of the website posting functionalities andd only kept it in "archive" mode, with
all the photos and content available but no new one added. By then several other websites with simmilar functionalties
started to popup all over and eventually in 2005 I killed the project completely to the dismay of a lot of its users.

Some 5 years later I created a Facebook page for its previous users to be able to interact, it still as some 900
followers, at: https://www.facebook.com/fotopt

# Code and future

I finally found some time to make the code of the website public. Given it is code with more than 20 years, in ASP
and Access, it surely has no other use other than serving as a piece of history. It also has a very outdated web
development framework and is was developed by a then very juniour me.

I make it here available with the GNU license, free to be used within its rules. 

## Thanks

To all its users and all the people that somehow helped me ideate, grow it and create such a life rewarding 
communitie and experience.
